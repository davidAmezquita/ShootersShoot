# ShootersShoot

Shooters Shoot is a simple 2D game in which the player must shoot a bullet and have it ricochet off of walls in order to hit their target. Each bullet has a limited amount of collisions it can go through before it dissapears. The player must defeat all the enemies before his bullets run out.
The SFML library was utilized to create all of the graphics for the game.

The background images of this game do not belong to me so they where not included in the assets folder, therefore if you wish to run the game, get a 1216x640 image and name it m_background and m2_background in order to get the game to run.
